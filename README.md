This is a TCP port scanner. Given a host IP (\<host\>) and the PORT (\<port\>) to scan, it tells you if the port is OPEN or NOT.

How to run the program:
1. Inside the root directory build the program with this make command: "make portscanner"
2. Run the program with both a host IP and a TCP port: "sudo ./portscanner \<host\> \<tcp port\>
